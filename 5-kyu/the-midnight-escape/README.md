The forest's darkness envelops them, and they must return to civilization before dawn. However, a rickety-old bridge stands between them and safety. With only one flashlight and limited time, they face a critical challenge. Can you help them devise the most efficient strategy to cross the treacherous bridge and make it home safely?</p><hr><h2 id="problem-description">Problem Description</h2><p>You are tasked with creating an algorithm to help a group of people cross a narrow bridge in the shortest possible time. The bridge can only support two people at once, and a flashlight must be carried on every crossing.
