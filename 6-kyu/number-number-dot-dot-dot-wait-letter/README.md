Each number has a single alphabet letter somewhere within it.</p><pre><code>Example : "24z6 1x23 y369 89a 900b"</code></pre><p>As shown above, this alphabet letter can appear anywhere within the number. You have to extract the letters and sort the numbers according to their corresponding letters. </p><pre><code>Example : "24z6 1x23 y369 89a 900b" will become 89 900 123 369 246 (ordered according to the alphabet letter)</code></pre><p>Here comes the difficult part, now you have to do a series of computations on the numbers you have extracted.</p><ul><li>The sequence of computations are <code>+ - * /</code>. Basic math rules do <strong>NOT</strong> apply, you have to do each computation in exactly this order.</li><li>This has to work for any size of numbers sent in (after division, go back to addition, etc).</li><li>In the case of duplicate alphabet letters, you have to arrange them according to the number that appeared first in the input string.</li><li>Remember to also round the final answer to the nearest integer.</li></ul><pre><code>Examples :"24z6 1x23 y369 89a 900b" = 89 + 900 - 123 * 369 / 246 = 1299"24z6 1z23 y369 89z 900b" = 900 + 369 - 246 * 123 / 89 = 1414"10a 90x 14b 78u 45a 7b 34y" = 10 + 45 - 14 * 7 / 78 + 90 - 34 = 60</code></pre><p>Good luck and may the CODE be with you!</p>
